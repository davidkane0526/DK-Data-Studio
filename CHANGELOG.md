# Changelog

## 3.21.1 — Windows Android environment hotfix

- Fixed `android-check` crashing under Windows PowerShell 5.1 because `$home` collided case-insensitively with the read-only automatic variable `$HOME`.
- Reworked Java/JDK discovery to use non-reserved variable names and a pipeline-clean candidate array.
- Prevented Java discovery from leaking collection-operation return values into the function result.
- Added regression guards against writing to PowerShell read-only/automatic variables in Windows tooling.

## 3.21.0 — DK Data Studio UI / plugin surfaces / auxiliary windows

- Renamed the application to **DK Data Studio** and standardized installable plugin packages on `.dkplugin`.
- Enlarged and regrouped the desktop command shell; resonance Activity and resonance-specific commands now share one visual group.
- Added plugin-owned `ui.selectionMenus` for box-selection actions and moved the final hard-coded main-view reset action into the resonance plugin.
- Persisted group-chart columns as a machine UI preference so opening/importing projects cannot reset the layout to one chart per row.
- Import command now opens the workbench only; the native file picker opens only from the explicit “导入文件” action.
- Data Center, TER and Pulse Activities now default to separate Electron BrowserWindows and synchronize their project snapshot on close.
- Android release build auto-discovers the SDK/adb and Android Studio JBR/JDK from environment, standard locations and Windows install metadata.
- Release APK remains `mobile-dist/DK-Data-Studio.apk`; Android metadata is `0.3.0`, versionCode `4`, package `com.dk.datastudio`.
- Added v3.21 regression checks for the plugin-owned selection menu, auxiliary windows, persisted layout, explicit import picker and Android environment discovery.

## plugin branch — 3.20.0-plugin.3

- Android toolbox now builds the release variant with `assembleRelease` and a dedicated persistent local release signing identity.
- Final Android artifact is normalized to `mobile-dist/DK-Data-Studio.apk`.
- Connected-device runs use Expo's `--variant release`, and the direct mobile npm workflow matches it.
- EAS production output is now APK instead of app bundle.
- Android app version advanced to `0.2.1` / versionCode `3` for clean replacement installs.
- Windows tooling regression tests now guard the release-only APK workflow.

## plugin branch — 3.20.0-plugin.2

- fixed Windows PowerShell command argument forwarding so `npm install`, `npm start`, checks, tests, builds, Android and update actions receive their arguments correctly;
- replaced fragile WinForms absolute-coordinate construction with a responsive card layout compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1;
- added explicit dependency repair and desktop-tooling diagnostics actions to both CLI and GUI;
- added Windows-tooling regression checks to `npm run check` and `npm test`;
- kept the PowerShell sources UTF-8 with BOM so Chinese UI text is decoded correctly by Windows PowerShell 5.1.

## plugin branch — 3.19.0-plugin.1

- moved resonance sidebar/range menu/physics/gate/spacing UI ownership into `builtin.resonance-workbench`;

- added detector-owned parameter UI, presets and evidence-marker metadata;
- removed permanent manual-operation instructions and main-plot shortcut hint;
- moved TER and Pulse page markup/event bindings out of core HTML into their plugins;
- added Plugin Workspace/UI API v1.2 and strict architecture-boundary checks.
- added semantic context-toolbar groups and priority-aware overflow so plugin growth does not create a single long command strip;
- added trusted desktop `.dkplugin` install/update/uninstall support with rollback on failed plugin updates;
- added an installable external resonance-detector SDK example and package documentation.
